# third_party
This directory contains ("vendors") abbreviated copies of the following repositories:

* googleapis/google - https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/ 11fd1fb53d03cf4852d3f63d679292e3c7b6e7c8 (LICENSE, google/api, google/rpc)
* grpc-gateway - https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway 5c1639cccb7d6abc747643ed07321b0052b809d5 v2.0.1 (LICENSE.txt, protoc-gen-openapiv2/options)
* OpenAPI - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui 07a0416ff664583ff9f481cae7dace226c9f61ec (LICENSE, dist/)

The third_party/OpenAPI directory contains HTML, Javascript,
and CSS assets that dynamically generate Swagger documentation from a
Swagger-compliant API definition in [example.swagger.json](./example.swagger.json)
file. That file is auto-generated by running `make generate` in the root
of this repository. The static assets are copied from
[this dist folder](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/master/dist)
of the OpenAPI-UI project. After copying, [`index.html`](./OpenAPI/index.html)
is edited to load the swagger file from the local server instead of the default petstore.

See the respective LICENSE files for each project for the applicable license terms.
